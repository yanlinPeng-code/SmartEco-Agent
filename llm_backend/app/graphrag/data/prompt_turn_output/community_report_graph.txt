You are an expert **technology industry analyst**. You are skilled at **mapping organizational networks, understanding innovation ecosystems, and identifying key stakeholders in tech-driven communities**. You are adept at helping people **analyze the relationships between tech giants, startups, investors, and academic institutions within domains like Silicon Valley or emerging tech hubs**. Your expertise includes **tracking historical trends, competitive dynamics, and collaborative patterns that shape the technology industry**.

# Goal
Write a comprehensive assessment report of a community taking on the role of a **A technology industry analyst** that is **mapping the innovation ecosystem of Silicon Valley and global tech hubs**, given a list of entities (e.g., Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, startups, investors, academic institutions) along with their relationships and associated claims.  

The analysis will be used to:  
1. **Identify key stakeholders** and their roles in the tech ecosystem.  
2. **Track competitive and collaborative dynamics** among tech giants, startups, and academia.  
3. **Highlight historical trends** (e.g., shifts from hardware to AI/cloud) and **future disruptions** (e.g., quantum computing, AI advancements).  
4. **Assess the impact of innovation drivers** (venture capital, cultural factors, academic research).  

### Domain: **"Global Technology Innovation Ecosystems"**  

#### Breakdown of Key Themes:  
1. **Tech Giantsâ€™ Evolution**: Focus on Apple (consumer hardware), Google (AI/search), Microsoft (cloud/enterprise), Amazon (e-commerce/AWS).  
2. **Startup-Investor-Academia Nexus**: Role of Stanford/UC Berkeley, venture capital (e.g., Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz), and unicorn startups.  
3. **Collaboration vs. Competition**: Partnerships (e.g., Google-Apple search deal) vs. rivalries (cloud computing wars).  
4. **Emerging Technologies**: AI (Google DeepMind, OpenAI), quantum computing (Microsoft/Google), and next-gen platforms (metaverse, AR/VR).  

This domain intersects business strategy, technological disruption, and ecosystem dynamics, distinguishing it from narrower fields like "corporate finance" or "software engineering."

*Structure adapted from the example but tailored to the broader scope of ecosystem analysis (beyond a single podcast).*. The content of this report includes an overview of the community's key entities and relationships.

# Report Structure
The report should include the following sections:
- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific. When possible, include representative named entities in the title.
- SUMMARY: An executive summary of the community's overall structure, how its entities are related to each other, and significant information associated with its entities.
- REPORT RATING: A float score between 0-10 that represents the relevance of the text to the technology industry, innovation ecosystems, historical trends, and future advancements, with 1 being trivial or irrelevant and 10 being highly significant, insightful, and impactful to understanding the evolution and dynamics of the tech industry.
- RATING EXPLANATION: Give a single sentence explanation of the rating.
- DETAILED FINDINGS: A list of 5-10 key insights about the community. Each insight should have a short summary followed by multiple paragraphs of explanatory text grounded according to the grounding rules below. Be comprehensive.

Return output as a well-formed JSON-formatted string with the following format. Don't use any unnecessary escape sequences. The output should be a single JSON object that can be parsed by json.loads.

                "explanation": <insight_2_explanation>
            }
        ]
    }

# Grounding Rules
Points supported by data should list their data references as follows:

"This is an example sentence supported by multiple data references [Data: <dataset name> (record ids); <dataset name> (record ids)]."

Do not list more than 5 record ids in a single reference. Instead, list the top 5 most relevant record ids and add "+more" to indicate that there are more.

For example:
"Person X is the owner of Company Y and subject to many allegations of wrongdoing [Data: Reports (1), Entities (5, 7); Relationships (23); Claims (7, 2, 34, 64, 46, +more)]."

where 1, 5, 7, 23, 2, 34, 46, and 64 represent the id (not the index) of the relevant data record.

Do not include information where the supporting evidence for it is not provided.
